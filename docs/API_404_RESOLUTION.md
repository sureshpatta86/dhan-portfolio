# API 404 Error Resolution Summary

## Issue Identified
The API client was receiving HTTP 404 errors when making calls to internal Next.js API endpoints (e.g., `/api/portfolio/positions`). The root cause was a **double `/api` prefix** in the API requests.

## Root Cause Analysis
Through server log analysis, we discovered that requests were being made to `/api/api/portfolio/positions` instead of `/api/portfolio/positions`. This was happening because:

1. **API_ENDPOINTS constants** (in `src/lib/constants/index.ts`) included the full paths with `/api` prefix:
   ```typescript
   PORTFOLIO: {
     HOLDINGS: '/api/portfolio/holdings',
     POSITIONS: '/api/portfolio/positions',
     CONVERT_POSITION: '/api/portfolio/convert-position',
   }
   ```

2. **API_CONFIG.baseUrl** (in `src/lib/config/app.ts`) was set to `/api` by default:
   ```typescript
   baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || '/api'
   ```

3. **Environment variable** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` was set to `your_api_url_here` (placeholder), causing the fallback to `/api`.

## Solution Implemented
Fixed the API configuration by:

1. **Updated environment variable** in `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
   ```

2. **Updated API_CONFIG** in `src/lib/config/app.ts`:
   ```typescript
   export const API_CONFIG = {
     baseUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || '',  // Changed from '/api' to ''
     timeout: 30000,
     retries: 3,
   } as const;
   ```

## Verification
After implementing the fix:
- ✅ Direct API endpoint tests: `GET /api/portfolio/positions 200`
- ✅ Direct API endpoint tests: `GET /api/portfolio/holdings 200`
- ✅ API client tests: Working correctly with React Query hooks
- ✅ Application build: Successful compilation and type checking
- ✅ No more double `/api` prefixes in server logs

## Testing Results
Server logs now show correct API calls:
```
GET /api/portfolio/positions 200 in 1588ms
GET /api/portfolio/holdings 200 in 1591ms
```

## Architecture Considerations
The fix maintains the correct separation of concerns:
- **API_ENDPOINTS** contain the full paths from the root
- **API_CONFIG.baseUrl** is empty for internal APIs (Next.js handles routing)
- **internalApiClient** properly constructs URLs by concatenating baseUrl + endpoint

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: All API calls are now working correctly without 404 errors.

The refactored Next.js portfolio analysis application now has:
- Modern, scalable architecture with feature-based organization
- Properly functioning API client and service layer
- Eliminated code duplication and improved maintainability
- Resolved all API endpoint connectivity issues
