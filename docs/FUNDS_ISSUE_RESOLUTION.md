# Funds Page Issue Resolution Summary

## Issue Identified
The funds page was showing "unable to load funds" error due to incorrect API endpoint configuration and missing feature architecture for trading functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Incorrect API paths**: The `useDhanApi` hook was using outdated API path patterns (`/api/tradingapi/funds` instead of `/api/trading/funds`)
2. **Missing trading feature**: No proper feature-based architecture for trading functionality like funds and ledger
3. **Module loading errors**: Webpack module loading issues in development due to stale cache

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created New Trading Feature Architecture
- **Created `/src/features/trading/`** with proper feature-based structure:
  - `types.ts` - Trading-specific TypeScript interfaces
  - `services.ts` - API service layer using the standardized API client
  - `hooks.ts` - React Query hooks for trading data
  - `index.ts` - Feature exports

### 2. Fixed API Configuration
- **Updated API path resolution** in `useDhanApi.ts` to use correct endpoints
- **Created new `TradingService`** that uses the standardized `internalApiClient`
- **Implemented proper `useFunds` hook** using React Query with correct configuration

### 3. Updated Component Architecture
- **Updated `Funds.tsx`** to use the new trading feature hooks
- **Fixed TypeScript type mismatches** between old and new hook interfaces
- **Updated import statements** to use the new feature-based architecture

### 4. Cleaned Up Legacy Code
- **Removed old `useFunds.ts`** hook file that was using incorrect API paths
- **Updated main hooks exports** to use new trading feature hooks
- **Fixed Statements component** to work with new trading hooks

### 5. Resolved Build Issues
- **Fixed TypeScript compilation errors** related to hook interface changes
- **Aligned type definitions** between trading feature and existing types
- **Cleared Next.js cache** to resolve webpack module loading issues

## Testing Results
- ✅ **API endpoint working**: `GET /api/trading/funds 200` returning correct data
- ✅ **Build successful**: No TypeScript or compilation errors
- ✅ **Application loading**: Funds page now loads without errors
- ✅ **Data structure correct**: Proper funds data being returned from API

## Files Modified
1. `/src/features/trading/` - New trading feature directory
2. `/src/components/Funds.tsx` - Updated to use new hooks
3. `/src/components/Statements.tsx` - Fixed type and hook compatibility
4. `/src/lib/hooks/index.ts` - Updated exports
5. `/src/lib/hooks/useDhanApi.ts` - Fixed API path resolution
6. Removed `/src/lib/hooks/useFunds.ts` - Legacy file

## Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Feature-based organization**: Trading functionality now properly organized
- ✅ **Consistent API client usage**: All trading services use the standardized client
- ✅ **Proper TypeScript types**: Type safety maintained throughout
- ✅ **React Query integration**: Proper caching and error handling for trading data

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: The funds page now loads correctly and displays fund data without errors.

The portfolio analysis application now has:
- Properly functioning funds page with real data
- Modern feature-based architecture for trading functionality
- Consistent API client usage across all features
- No build or runtime errors
